Developing Financial Contracts with Marlowe

Objective: Dive into Marlowe contract development and testing.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will immerse yourself in Marlowe contract development by creating a real-world financial contract scenario using Marlowe. The objective is to provide students with hands-on experience in developing financial contracts with Marlowe, including defining contract parameters, participants, actions, and conditions. By completing this assignment, students will gain practical knowledge of how Marlowe can be applied to real-world financial scenarios.

Instructions:

Contract Conditions:

Specify the conditions under which certain actions are triggered or contract terms are met. Explain how the contract enforces its rules and conditions.
Development Process:

Document the development process of the Marlowe contract. Include code snippets and explanations for defining contract parameters, participants, actions, and conditions.
Testing and Verification:

Test and verify the Marlowe contract within the Marlowe development environment to ensure it functions as expected.
Challenges Faced:

Reflect on the development process and document any challenges or considerations you encountered while developing the financial contract with Marlowe. Explain how you addressed these challenges.
Submission:

Submit a document (e.g., a report or tutorial) that includes the development process, contract details, code snippets, testing results, and any relevant screenshots or diagrams.
