Interactive Plutus DApp Development

Objective: Dive deeper into Plutus DApp development by creating an interactive application.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will guide students in diving deeper into Plutus DApp development by creating an interactive application. The objective is to provide students with hands-on experience in developing a decentralized application (DApp) that involves user interactions and data processing on the Cardano blockchain. Students will choose a use case for their DApp, implement the chosen use case, and develop an interactive Plutus DApp that includes front-end elements for user input and feedback.

Instructions:

Choose a Use Case:

Instruct students to choose a use case for their decentralized application (DApp). Encourage them to select a use case that involves user interactions and data processing on the Cardano blockchain. Examples could include a voting DApp, a decentralized marketplace, or a gaming application.
Define DApp Features:

Have students define the features and functionalities their DApp will offer to users. These features should involve user interactions and data processing. Ensure that they have a clear understanding of what the DApp is designed to achieve.
Front-End Development:

Guide students through the front-end development process. Instruct them to create front-end elements that allow users to interact with the DApp, such as forms for input, buttons for actions, and feedback mechanisms to display results.
Back-End Development (Plutus Smart Contract):

Instruct students to develop the Plutus smart contract that will power the DApp. The smart contract should implement the logic and functionality required for the chosen use case.
Integration:

Ensure that students integrate the front-end and back-end components of the DApp effectively. They should establish communication between the user interface and the Plutus smart contract.
User Testing:

Instruct students to conduct user testing of their interactive Plutus DApp. Encourage them to gather feedback from potential users and make any necessary improvements.
Documentation:

Require students to document the entire development process, including explanations of the use case, front-end elements, Plutus smart contract logic, integration steps, and user testing results.
Submission:

Students should submit a document (e.g., a report or tutorial) that includes the development process, code samples, explanations, user testing results, and any relevant screenshots or diagrams.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful development of an interactive Plutus DApp that implements the chosen use case.
Clarity and comprehensiveness of the documentation, including explanations of the DApp's features, front-end elements, Plutus smart contract logic, and integration.
Effective user testing and incorporation of user feedback.
Overall quality of the assignment and adherence to submission guidelines.
