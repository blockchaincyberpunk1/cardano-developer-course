Smart Contract Testing and Deployment

Objective: Explore the testing and deployment of Plutus smart contracts.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will investigate the crucial process of testing Plutus smart contracts for functionality, security, and compliance with Cardano's blockchain. The objective is to provide students with insights into the testing and deployment phases of smart contract development, emphasizing the importance of thorough testing to ensure the contract operates as intended. You will create a test plan for the smart contract developed in Assignment 4, including scenarios for positive and negative testing, and explain how testing results inform deployment decisions.

Instructions:

Review the Smart Contract:

Familiarize yourself with the Plutus smart contract you developed in Homework Assignment 4. Understand its functionality, parameters, and expected outcomes.
Research Testing Strategies:

Investigate various testing strategies and best practices for smart contracts. Explore functional testing, security testing, and compliance testing relevant to Cardano's blockchain.
Create a Test Plan:

Develop a comprehensive test plan for your Plutus smart contract. Your test plan should include:
Scenarios for positive testing (valid inputs and expected outcomes).
Scenarios for negative testing (invalid inputs and how the contract should handle them).
Security testing considerations (e.g., checking for vulnerabilities, data handling).
Compliance testing criteria specific to Cardano's blockchain.
A test execution schedule and assignment of responsibilities (if applicable).
Testing Execution:

Execute the tests as per the test plan. Document the outcomes, including any issues or observations during testing.
Deployment Decisions:

Based on the testing results, discuss how they inform deployment decisions. Explain under what conditions the contract should proceed to deployment on Cardano's blockchain or if further revisions are necessary.
Submission:

Submit a document (e.g., a test plan report) that includes the test plan, testing results, deployment considerations, and any relevant observations.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Completeness and clarity of the test plan, including positive and negative testing scenarios.
Effective execution of tests and documentation of testing results.
Sound explanation of how testing results inform deployment decisions.
Consideration of security and compliance testing criteria.
Overall quality of the assignment and adherence to submission guidelines.
