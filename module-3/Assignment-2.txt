Functional Programming Principles in Plutus Development

Objective: Understand the fundamental principles of functional programming in the context of Plutus development.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will delve into the fundamental principles of functional programming and explore how these principles are applied when writing smart contracts in Plutus, Cardano's smart contract development language. The objective is to help students grasp the essence of functional programming and demonstrate its relevance to blockchain development. You will describe key principles such as immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions, providing examples of how they are applied in Plutus smart contract development.

Instructions:

Introduction to Functional Programming:

Begin by introducing the concept of functional programming. Explain its core principles and the benefits it offers in terms of code reliability, reusability, and maintainability.
Key Principles of Functional Programming:

Describe the following key principles of functional programming:
Immutability: Explain what immutability means in the context of functional programming and how it ensures data consistency and reliability.
Pure Functions: Define pure functions and discuss their significance in functional programming. Explain how they contribute to predictable and side-effect-free code.
Higher-Order Functions: Describe higher-order functions and their role in functional programming. Explain how they enable the composition of functions and the creation of more flexible and reusable code.
Application of Principles in Plutus:
