Developing Smart Contracts on Plutus

Objective: Dive deeper into Plutus development by creating smart contracts for Cardano.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will explore Plutus development in-depth by creating a smart contract for Cardano that addresses a real-world use case. The objective is to provide students with hands-on experience in developing complex Plutus smart contracts and gaining an understanding of how blockchain technology can be applied to real-world scenarios. You will choose a real-world use case, develop a Plutus smart contract to address it, describe the contract's functionality, parameters, and any potential complexities in its implementation.

Instructions:

Select a Real-World Use Case:

Choose a real-world use case for which a smart contract on Cardano could provide a solution or streamline a process. This could include decentralized finance (DeFi), supply chain management, voting systems, or any other relevant scenario.
Design and Develop the Smart Contract:

Using Plutus, design and develop a smart contract that addresses the chosen use case. The contract should have well-defined functionality and parameters.
Document the development process, including the code logic, variable descriptions, and any decision-making processes related to the contract's design.
Describe the Contract's Functionality:

Provide a comprehensive description of the smart contract's functionality. Explain how it operates, its purpose, and how it addresses the chosen use case.
Parameters and Inputs:

Specify the contract's parameters and inputs. Explain how users or external systems can interact with the contract and provide inputs.
Complexities and Considerations:

Identify and discuss any potential complexities or challenges in implementing the smart contract. This could include considerations related to security, data handling, or contract execution.
Testing and Verification:

Test and verify the smart contract's functionality within the Plutus development environment to ensure it functions as expected.
Submission:

Submit a document (e.g., a report or presentation) that includes explanations, code samples, contract functionality details, and any relevant screenshots or diagrams. Make sure to address the chosen use case thoroughly.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful development of a Plutus smart contract for the chosen real-world use case.
Clarity and thoroughness of documentation, including detailed explanations of the contract's functionality and parameters.
Effective testing and verification of the smart contract's functionality.
Identification and discussion of potential complexities or challenges in implementing the contract.
Overall quality of the assignment and adherence to submission guidelines.
