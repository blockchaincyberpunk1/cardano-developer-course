Writing Custom Scripts in Plutus

Objective: Gain hands-on experience in writing custom scripts for Plutus smart contracts.

Assignment Description:

In this assignment, you will gain practical experience in writing custom scripts for Plutus smart contracts using the Plutus development environment. The objective is to provide students with hands-on experience in creating custom scripts in Haskell, which is a crucial skill for Plutus smart contract development. You will create a simple custom script, document the process of writing it, explain its logic, variables, and functions, and include code samples and explanations.

Instructions:

Access the Plutus Development Environment:

Access the Plutus development environment, which provides tools for writing, testing, and simulating Plutus smart contracts.
Choose a Use Case:

Select a simple use case or scenario for your custom script. This could be a payment script, a basic financial contract, or any other straightforward application.
Write the Custom Script:

Using Haskell, write a custom script to fulfill the chosen use case. Your script should demonstrate an understanding of Haskell's syntax and functional programming principles.
Document the Script-Writing Process:

Create a document (e.g., a report or tutorial) that includes the following:
An introduction to the use case and the purpose of the custom script.
Detailed explanations of the variables, functions, and logic used in the script.
Code samples and snippets to illustrate key aspects of the script.
Any challenges or considerations encountered while writing the script and how they were addressed.
Testing and Verification:

Test and verify your custom script within the Plutus development environment to ensure it functions as expected.
Submission:

Submit your document, including explanations, code samples, and any relevant screenshots, by the due date specified by your instructor.
Grading Criteria:

Your assignment will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Successful creation of a custom script in Haskell for the chosen use case.
Clarity and thoroughness of documentation, including detailed explanations of variables, functions, and logic.
Effective testing and verification of the custom script.
Insightful discussion of any challenges or considerations encountered during the script-writing process.
Overall quality of the assignment and adherence to submission guidelines.
